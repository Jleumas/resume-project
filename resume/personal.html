                Hello, my name is Sam and I'm an aspiring software developer. I've worked in the biotech industry for the last 7 years and my roles have increasingly grown to include
                software and automation, and I've decided to progress further within this field. I have a deep love of computers and have been studying computer hardware and software
                systems and architecture since 2017. After a year of self-learning, I decided it was time to receive a formal education to make sure the breadth and depth of my
                knowledge wouldn't be limited by the unknown unknowns: the things that I didn't know I didn't know.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not validating computer systems at work and making projects on the side at home, I'm an avid runner, weightlifter, hiker and backpacker. I've taught myself
                how to sew and love taking my dog, Reggie, to the dog park and on runs through the woods. Overall, I'm a highly active person both in physical and mental pursuits,
                and can promise that I'll bring that same energy to any new opportunity that comes my way.
            </p>
